# PCA implementation is done in Python and can be found at PCA.py file. The required datasets, pca_a, pca_b, pca_c files are placed in the same directory as that of the code file. 

# The user must specify the dataset name against which PCA is to be run incommandline, when prompted.
# Ex: The following prompt will be shown in command line:
	Enter the dataset name: pca_a.txt
#Instead of pca_a.txt, the user can specify any data set name and/or path to that file if it is not present in the same directory as that of the code.

#This program can be run on Anaconda with Python 3.5 or using normal Python, after installing numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn packages first.

# If using Anaconda, open the program in Spyder and run it using the green arrow symbol. If normal python implementation is followed, then open the program in IDLE and select Run -> Run Module (F5).
